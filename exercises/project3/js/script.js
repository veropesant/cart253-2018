Experiment with camera
VÃ©ronique Pesant

Eventually my goal is to create a drawing tool using the webcam.
It would preferably be used in front of a white background to make the
colors pop out more.
I would like to scan the pixels on the webcam and spot for example which
pixels are bright red, and then track these pixels and create a line as
the user moves the object around, using this same color,
allowing the user to draw.

In this second experiment, I explore the pixel array and what I can do with it,
based on a video by The Coding Train. Eventually, I want to use the pixel array to track
bright color pixels on the canvas and use their rgb value to draw.
