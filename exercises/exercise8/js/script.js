Experiment with camera
VÃ©ronique Pesant

Eventually my goal is to create a drawing tool using the webcam.
It would preferably be used in front of a white background to make the
colors pop out more.
I would like to scan the pixels on the webcam and spot for example which
pixels are bright red, and then track these pixels and create a line as
the user moves the object around, using this same color,
allowing the user to draw.

In this first experiment, I simply try to use the webcam and spot the colors
of the pixels, because that's something I've never worked with previously.
